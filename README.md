# PHARMA-ANOMALY-DETECTION

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in industrial equipment used in pharmaceutical bottle manufacturing. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and unsupervised learning techniques, we analyzed over 90 million time-stamped sensor records to identify failure patterns and quality issues.

## Objective

To uncover potential causes of premature equipment failure and high rejection rates in the bottle manufacturing process by analyzing sensor data related to temperature, pressure, and energy consumption.

## Key Contributions

- Performed large-scale EDA on 90M+ records of multivariate time series data.
- Identified critical anomalies in thermal and pressure signals using clustering and anomaly detection algorithms.
- Validated hypotheses relating unstable thermal behavior and pressure spikes with increases in rejected bottles and machine downtime.

## Methods

- Statistical summary, boxplots, rolling mean/std analysis
- Heatmaps and correlation analysis
- Outlier detection via IQR, Z-score, and ML-based approaches (DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, LOF)
